All of the AI listed have similar functionality for chasing to get in range,
fleeing when the player is too close, resting when below half health, and 
resuming chasing when health is back to full. Then I branched off of this base
behavior to make the tanks feel like different entities.

Coward AI:

The coward AI will chase the player, and if within a certain range, will "hear"
the player fire a shell, and immediately flee for a set time. This behavior can happen
during all of the other states, unless already fleeing.

Hunter AI:

The hunter AI will follow the player until within the "hunt radius". If the player is
close enough, the hunter will then stop and start firing at the player's current position
with an increased fire rate. This AI doesn't have chase and shoot behavior, and can only
fire when sitting still and hunting. If the player gets too close, the tank flees, then 
resumes trying to get into hunt range.

Patrol AI:

The patrol AI follows a set patrol path unless the player enters its raycast, (Vision/LOS)
in which case it will immediately chase and shoot at the player. It moves slightly slower than other
tanks so that the player has a chance to leave its range. If player leaves range, 
the AI searches for nearest waypoint, sets that as current, and resumes patrol route.

Bomber AI:
Similar to hunter AI, though it never allows the player to get too close. It stays within
2 different radii, at larger range than the AISenseRadius. It drops explosive rounds that
hit in an Area of Effect, and aims at a space just ahead of where the tank is currently moving.
